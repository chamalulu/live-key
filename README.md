# Live-key

The goal of this project is to set up a live-system primarily to host my GPG
keys.

There are reasons for not having your primary (certifying) private key stored on
your every-day work machine. The canonical solution is to have another air-
gapped machine where you can sign keys transferred by 5Â¼" floppy disk.
I think a more practical (albeit less secure) way is to have a live system on a
USB stick without networking which you reboot into when you need to sign a key.

I'm sure this has been solved a thousand times before but I'm all for being the
1,001st guy inventing the wheel all over again.

The live system should be as vanilla as possible with a few modifications.

- Networking is disabled.
  (&#x1f6a7; Currently implemented in the lamest possible way.)
- `/home` is persisted on an encrypted writable filesystem on the medium and it
  must survive rebuilds of the live system. (&#x2705; Solved)
- A non-encrypted filesystem for transfers also reside on the medium. A rebuild
  of the live system should preserve its contents if space allows. It is mounted
  under `/mnt/transfer` after boot. (&#x2705; Solved)
- Block devices on target host may of course also be mounted but this should not
  be done automatically.

_As vanilla as possible_ may sound strange considering this project depends on
[Debian Live](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianLive) which is quiet big compared to
a handcrafted live system.

Actually, my next project could be inventing this particular wheel yet again,
but with [LFS](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/).

## Modifications

### Keyboard layout files

Package console-setup is installed in live system and /etc/default contains
keyboard files for setting up my SiliconGraphics and ThinkPad keyboards.

```sh
# setupcon -k -v ThinkPad
```

or

```sh
# setupcon -k -v SiliconGraphics
```

They are of course opinionated and specific for my keyboards and no, you can't
borrow my keyboards, I'm using them.

### Bring down all network devices except loopback

To airgap the live system all network interfaces except loopback will be
brought down.
There are of course much more secure and/or robust ways to isolate a live
system but we'll start here.

live-config runs the component `9999-down-links` in late userspace boot.

```sh
#!/bin/sh

for LINK in `ls /sys/class/net/ | grep --invert-match lo`; do
    ip link set $LINK down
done
```

### /home on encrypted filesystem image

Package cryptsetup is installed in live system.

`persistence persistence-encryption=none,luks` is added to boot parameters.

The image of the encrypted filesystem can be created by the script
`create_persistence.sh` given the name of the image to create.

## Testing in virtual machine

The Makefile has two phony test targets, `test` and `ptest`.

`test` dependes on the iso image. It starts a VM with the iso image attached to
the cdrom drive.

`ptest` depends on the iso image and an image of an encrypted peristence block
device. It starts a VM with the iso image as in `test` and also the persistence
image attached as removable usb storage.

### Updating USB drive

The Makefile has a phony target `update`. It depends on the iso image. It
executes `update_usb.sh` with the iso image and `myUSB` as parameters.

`myUSB` should be a symlink to the usb block device.

### Bootstrapping USB drive

The target `update` requires an existing Live-key environment on a USB drive.
Executing the script `create_usb.sh` with the iso image and `myUSB` as
parameters will write the iso image to the USB drive as well as creating an
encrypted partition for home and a partition for transfer.

You can now reboot from the USB drive and create your keys there, export public
keys and private subkeys (_not_ the primary) to `/mnt/transfer`, reboot to your
work system and import.

When you need to sign keys or create new keys, which is not every day, you use
the live system transferring key material over `/mnt/transfer`.

## TODOs

### `myUSB` target selection

A target for `myUSB` could be defined in the Makefile which prompts the user for
a target in `/dev/disk/by-id/` to set up the symlink to.
